# My First Website

This was part of an 8-week course on Intro to Web Development with Code First Girls.
We were encouraged to use basic HTML with Bootstrap classes as well as any additional bespoke CSS styles that we created.

As part of the project we were put into groups and here is my contribution to the group for our group's chosen theme.

# Course Project Brief:
‘Must have’
• A minimum of 2 HTML web pages and one external CSS file
• A website wireframe
• Use a CSS framework
• All links working
• Basic user interaction (Ex: hover, submit form, Action on click)
• Adhering to UI/UX rules

‘Nice to have’
• All of the ‘Must Have criteria’
• Mobile responsive website
